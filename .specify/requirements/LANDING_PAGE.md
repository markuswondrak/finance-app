# Design Brief: "Finanz-App" Landing Page

## 1. General Style & Theme
* **Color Palette:** Deep Black/Charcoal background (`#0a0a0a`), Neon Green accents (`#2ecc71` or `#00ff88` for highlights), and subtle Dark Grey cards.
* **Typography:** Modern Sans-Serif (e.g., Inter or Montserrat). Bold headings for impact, clean light text for descriptions.
* **Atmosphere:** Dark mode, high-tech, motivational, and clean. No clutter.

## 2. Layout Sections

### **Section 1: The Hero (Visual Hook)**
* **Left Column:** * **Headline:** "Master Your Tomorrow, Starting Today." (Large, Bold)
    * **Sub-headline:** "Stop guessing. Start knowing. Track your costs, forecast your balance, and build a future-proof budget with Finanz-App."
    * **CTA Buttons:** Two prominent "Sign up with Google" and "Sign up with GitHub" buttons using official brand colors but matching the dark theme.
* **Right Column:** A high-quality mock-up/screenshot of the **Balance Forecast Graph** from the app, slightly tilted in 3D or with a soft neon glow behind it.

#### **Section 2: The "Future-Proof" Feature Grid**
Three cards with glassmorphism effects (semi-transparent dark background) and neon green icons:
1.  **Smart Forecasting:** "See your bank balance months in advance. Predict your financial health before the month even starts."
2.  **Flexible Cost Tracking:** "Monthly bills, quarterly insurance, or that one-time vacation—track everything in one place."
3.  **Debt Prevention:** "Identify savings potential and stay in the green with automated alerts and visual balance trends."

### **Section 3: The Interactive Preview (Centered)**
* A large, centered container showing the **"Niedrigster Stand" (Lowest Balance)** widget from the image. 
* **Text above it:** "No more bad surprises. We highlight your lowest projected balance so you can plan ahead with confidence."

### **Section 4: Roadmap Teaser (The Wealth Management Hook)**
* A slightly dimmed, "Coming Soon" section.
* **Headline:** "Your Wealth, Optimized."
* **Description:** "Currently building: Portfolio tracking and savings plan automation. Go from debt-free to wealth-builder within the same ecosystem."

### **Section 5: Footer / Final CTA**
* **Headline:** "Ready to take control? It’s 100% Free."
* Simple Social Login icons again (Google/GitHub).
* Links: Terms, Privacy, and "Back to Top."

## 3. Visual Details for the Agent
* **Gradients:** Use a subtle radial gradient in the background (center-top) with a faint green tint to prevent a "flat" black look.
* **Borders:** All cards should have a very thin 1px border (`#ffffff10`) and rounded corners (12px–16px).
* **Animations:** Use subtle "fade-in-up" animations as the user scrolls down. The forecast graph in the hero section should ideally have a slight "drawing" animation on load.
