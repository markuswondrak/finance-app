- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Validation Notes

**Validation Date**: 2025-12-13

All checklist items pass:
- Spec focuses on visual appearance outcomes (WHAT) without prescribing implementation (HOW)
- User stories are independently testable and prioritized
- Functional requirements use clear MUST language and are verifiable
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (percentages, time, WCAG standards)
- Edge cases for zero values and long numbers are addressed
- Assumptions are documented clearly

**Status**: PASS - Ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
