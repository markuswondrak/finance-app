# Implementation Plan: Shared Finance Workspace

**Branch**: `021-shared-workspace` | **Date**: 2025-12-26 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/021-shared-workspace/spec.md`

## Summary

Transition the application from a user-centric data model to a workspace-centric model. This allows multiple users to access and manage the same financial data (fixed costs, etc.) with peer-to-peer permissions. The implementation includes workspace creation/naming, a one-time use invite system with email notifications via Mailjet, a destructive join flow with high-friction warnings, and user offboarding/revocation logic.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Go 1.17+ (Backend), JavaScript (Vue 3.3.4) (Frontend)
- **Primary Dependencies**: Gin (Router), GORM (ORM) for Backend; Vuetify 3.3.15, Vue Router 4.2+, Chart.js 4.4.0 for Frontend.
**Storage**: PostgreSQL 15+ (GORM managed)
**Testing**: Go standard testing + testify (Backend), Vitest + Vue Test Utils (Frontend).
**Target Platform**: Linux (Docker/Cloud Run)
**Project Type**: Web application (Frontend + Backend)
**Performance Goals**: API latency < 200ms for workspace operations; real-time access revocation.
**Constraints**: 
- 60% test coverage mandate (Constitution IV).
- Fintech Dark Mode aesthetic (Constitution VII).
- Page-Centric Frontend Architecture (Constitution VIII).
- Data loss must be confirmed and transactional (Constitution VI).
**Scale/Scope**: Support multiple users per workspace; infinite horizontal scaling of workspaces.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| I. Simplicity First | Pass | Workspace-centric model is the simplest way to support multi-user sharing. |
| II. UX Excellence | Pass | High-friction modal for destructive join ensures user awareness. |
| III. Full-Stack Separation | Pass | Clear separation between workspace management API and frontend settings. |
| IV. Test Coverage | Pass | Plan includes unit and integration tests for new logic. |
| V. API-First Design | Pass | OpenAPI contracts will be defined in Phase 1. |
| VI. Data Integrity | Pass | Destructive operations require confirmation; transactions used for data migration. |
| VII. Visual Design | Pass | Settings page will follow Fintech Dark Mode. |
| VIII. Frontend Architecture | Pass | New components will be placed in `src/components/settings/`. |

**Structure Decision**: Web application (Option 2) as it involves both Go backend and Vue frontend.
